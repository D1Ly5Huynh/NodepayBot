## Features

- **Automated API Interactions**: Handles session initialization, pings, and connection states.
- **Proxy Support**: Enables using proxies for improved security and anonymity.
- **Token Management**: Reads and utilizes tokens for authenticated interactions.
- **Logging**: Real-time and colorful logs powered by `loguru` for better debugging and monitoring.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjustable ping intervals and retry limits.

## Get NP_TOKEN
Retrieving `np_token`: A quick guide to find your `np_token`:

- Open the webpage in your browser.
- Press `F12` or use `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) to open the developer console.
- Go to the **Console** tab.
- Enter the following command:

     ```javascript
     localStorage.getItem('np_token');
     ```
- The value displayed is your `np_token`.
- Save `np_token` to `tokens.txt`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Enukio/NodepayBot.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd NodepayBot
   ```

2. Place your API tokens in a file named `tokens.txt` (one token per line).

3. If using proxies, create a file named `proxy.txt` and list your proxies (one per line).

---

## Usage
1. **Prepare Configuration Files:**
   - **`tokens.txt`:** A list of tokens for API authentication. One token per line.
   - **`proxies.txt` (optional):** A list of proxies in the format `protocol://user:pass@host:port`. One proxy per line.

2. **Run the Script:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### Optional:
- Choose whether to use proxies when prompted.
- View real-time logs in the terminal, including ping successes, failures, and connection states.

## Need Proxy?
1. Sign up at [Proxies.fo](https://app.proxies.fo/ref/d02516e7-56b3-9a1f-b7ca-1fb08669f7a6).
2. Go to [Plans](https://app.proxies.fo/plans) and only purchase the "ISP plan" (Residential plans donâ€™t work).
3. Top up your balance, or you can directly buy a plan and pay with Crypto!
4. Go to the Dashboard, select your ISP plan, and click "Generate Proxy."
5. Set the proxy format to `protocol://username:password@hostname:port` and choose any number for the proxy count.
6. Paste the proxies into `proxy.txt`.

---

## Configuration

You can adjust the following parameters in the `main.py` file:

- `PING_INTERVAL`: Interval between pings (in seconds).
- `RETRIES_LIMIT`: Maximum retry attempts before declaring a failure.
- API endpoints are specified in the `DOMAIN_API_ENDPOINTS` dictionary.
